## :bee: Overview
An IMPROVED SGC actions and opinions tracker! 
Submit your opinions to actions discussed during SGC
Now with login functionality!

This project is hosted on Heroku: http://lost-and-fac.herokuapp.com/


## How to set :up: ?
- git clone and cd into this repo
- in the terminal run `npm i` to install all dependencies 
- run `npm start` and view on localhost:7007 in your browser
- You can run `npm run go` to run with nodemon
> Currently, we haven't fully set up the login process so go to localhost:7007/public/login.html to access the login page. A dummy user has been set up to test the login functionality: Username- jk Password - aDuMmy

## 🎯 Goals
- [ ] login + sign up page
- [ ] use cookie to verify log in status
- [ ] assign users to opinions
- [ ] have username visible on each page
- [ ] write at least one more test

## 🎳 Stretch Goals
- [ ] login/sign-up page animation
- [ ] session ID cookies
- [ ] sign up with Github
- [ ] admin privileges for FAC16
- [ ] add action points
- [ ] remove opinions
- [ ] use promises
- [ ] sign up functionality

## 📝 Planning & Process
1. brainstormed ideas
2. separated goals and stretch goals
3. wrote out user journey and tasks list
4. deploy on Heroku
5. add new function for hashing, validating
6. add new routes, handlers and queries for login 

## :sweat_drops: Problems
* very little time
* struggled to understand callbacks
* losing energy and focus (week 7 slump?)

## :wrench: Built with:
* html
* css
* javascript
* node.js
* heroku
* postgresql
